# The obligatory todo list - this one built with jQuery
I wanted to build a simple app to solidify some knowledge with Sass and jQuery.  I present to you the humble todo list.  Nothing special but below are some instructions:

* type a todo in the box and hit enter to add it to the list
* click the todo in the list to mark it as done (strike through)
* on mouseover a red 'x' appears - click it to delete the todo
* click the arrow at the top right of the list to show/hide the input area
* the buttons at the bottom are not working - they were added for visual value only

Here's a screenshot if you'd like to see it:
